# Student-Selector



This program is a random student selector. To start, there are 250 stars, and each of the 10 students have a random number of stars attributed to them, all adding up to 250 in total. The student with the most number of stars is selected and their student number and name are printed. If there is a tie between two students, the program randomly one of the two students.
